# Trademarks
We started with a search for "Amazon Technologies" under "Name and address" in the U.S. Patent and Trademark office [TESS basic word mark search](https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=login&p_lang=english&p_d=trmk). We looked for "plural and singular."

We removed any records where the WORD MARK field was empty or null.

We filtered to include all trademarks, omitting marks that were only service marks.

We filtered to include only trademarks listed as LIVE.

We filtered out one record for a DESIGN ONLY mark.

We deduplicated by WORD MARK.

We filtered out marks with descriptions that contained the word "software."

This gave us 336 records, which we manually reviewed. 

We removed clear duplicates (e.g., Amazon Basics and AmazonBasics were considered dupes, MXG and M X G were considered dupes. There was a mark for DR, Daily Ritual, and DR Daily Ritual, so we removed D R Daily Ritual; there were marks for GT, Goodthreads, and GT Goodthreads, so we removed GT Goodthreads. Amazon Basic Care and Basic Care were not considered dupes). 

We removed brands that were solely names of entertainment, such as a book or TV series, but left them in if they were also marked for other goods such as clothing.

We removed trademarks for "features" of devices (e.g., Blue Shade) and corporate programs (e.g., Green Mission). 

We removed marks that said "CANCELLED" in the description.

We removed apparent advertising slogans (e.g., "dinner for 2 in about 30 minutes").

We removed in-house quality ratings (e.g., "pasture raised" and "responsible grown best").

If there was a brand with multiple instances, such as Mama Bear, Mama Bear Fiercely Adorable, Mama Bear Skin Care, we went with just the umbrella parent brand Mama Bear and considered it one brand. 

We removed those brands that are no longer registered to Amazon/Whole Foods (e.g., Bread & Circus), unless they are widely known as Amazon brands (e.g., Ring).

We added those from Amazon's "Our Brands" page that were not already listed.

We searched Whole Foods registered brands to see if they were subbrands and removed if so.

We searched Amazon registered brands to see if they were slogans or subbrands and removed if so.

We downloaded all the "software" trademarks that were removed, checked manually, and added back any that were erroneously removed.

We added brands registered to Zappos, which is owned by Amazon.
